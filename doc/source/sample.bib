The relationships among processing, structure, properties, and performance components for steels, glass-ceramics, polymer fibers, and silicon semiconductors are explored throughout the chapters. The discussion of the construction of crystallographic directions in hexagonal unit cells is expanded. At the end of each chapter, engineers will also find revised summaries and new equation summaries to reexamine key concepts.},

abstract = {Nanoporous metals prepared by the corrosion of an alloy can take the form of monolithic, millimeter-sized bodies containing approximately 10 15 nanoscale ligaments per cubic millimeter. The ligament size can reach down to the very limits of stability of nanoscale objects. The processes by which nanoporous metals are formed have continued to be fascinating, even though their study in relation to surface treatment, metal refinement, and failure mechanisms can be traced back to ancient times. In fact, the prospect of using alloy corrosion as a means of making nanomaterials for fundamental studies and functional applications has led to a revived interest in the process. The quite distinct mechanical properties of nanoporous metals are one of the focus points of this interest, as relevant studies probe the deformation behavior of crystals at the lower end of the size scale. Furthermore, the coupling of bulk stress and strain to the forces acting along the surface of nanoporous metals provide unique opportunities for controlling the mechanical behavior through external variables such as the electrical or chemical potentials.},

@article{Harris2020,
   abstract = {<p> Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves <sup>1</sup> and in the first imaging of a black hole <sup>2</sup> . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis. </p>},

In this paper, we present a q -variant of the PRP ( q -PRP) method for which both the sufficient and conjugacy conditions are satisfied at every iteration. The proposed method is convergent globally with standard Wolfe conditions and strong Wolfe conditions. The numerical results show that the proposed method is promising for a set of given test problems with different starting points. Moreover, the method reduces to the classical PRP method as the parameter q approaches 1.},

abstract = {Ductile failure is studied in a bcc HfNbTaZr High Entropy Alloy (HEA) with a pre-existing void. Using molecular dynamics simulations of uniaxial tensile tests, we explore the effect of void radius on the elastic modulus and yield stress. The elastic modulus scales with porosity as in closed-cell foams. The critical stress for dislocation nucleation as a function of the void radius is very well described by a model designed after pure bcc metals, taking into account a larger core radius for the HEA. Twinning takes place as a complementary deformation mechanism, and some detwinning occurs at large strain. No solid-solid phase transitions are identified. The concurrent effects of element size mismatch and plasticity lead to significant lattice disorder. By comparing our HEA results to pure tantalum simulations, we show that the critical stress for dislocation nucleation and the resulting dislocation densities are much lower than for pure Ta, as expected from lower energy barriers due to chemical complexity},

@article{Huber2014,
abstract = {This study is motivated by discrepancies between recent experimental compression test data of nanoporus gold and the scaling laws for strength and elasticity by Gibson and Ashby. We present a systematic theoretical investigation of the relationship between microstructure and macroscopic behaviour of nanoporous metals. The microstructure is modelled by four-coordinated spherical nodes interconnected by cylindrical struts. The node positions are randomly displaced from the lattice points of a diamond lattice. We report scaling laws for Young's modulus and yield strength, which depend on the extension of nodal connections between the ligaments and the solid fraction. A comparison with the scaling laws of Gibson and Ashby revealed a significant deviation for the yield stress. The model was applied for identifying a continuum constitutive law for the solid fraction. Matching the model's predicted macroscopic stress-strain behaviour to experimental data for the flow stress at large compression strain requires the incorporation of work hardening in the constitutive law. Furthermore, the amount of disorder of the node positions is decisive in matching the model results to the experimental observations of an anomalously low stiffness and an almost complete lack of transverse plastic strain. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

It testifies that the mechanical response of np metals can be well described by the classical scaling equations, providing that the network connectivity and the size effects are taken into account properly.

@article{Jin2009,
abstract = {Nanoporous metals prepared by alloy corrosion may assume the form of monolithic, millimeter-sized bodies containing around 1015 nanoscale ligaments per cubic millimeter. Here, we report on the fabrication and mechanical behavior of macroscopic, crack-free nanoporous gold samples which exhibit excellent ductility in compression tests. Their yield stress is significantly lower than that expected based on scaling laws or on previous nanoindentation experiments. Electron backscatter diffraction imaging reveals a polycrystalline microstructure with grains larger than 10 $\mu$m which acquire a subdomain structure during plastic flow, but remain otherwise intact. We highlight the action of lattice dislocations which can travel over distances much larger than the ligament size. This results in a collective deformation of the many ligaments in each grain. Remarkably, the dislocation cores are partly located in the pore channels. The results suggest a critical view of the conversion between indentation hardness and yield stress in previous work. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},
